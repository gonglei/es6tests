### How do I use it ###

The test directory contains all unit tests specs ordered by the original sequence. Those unit tests are fixed. The git history of the repository shows all original unit tests, it logs every original unit test and solved one by sequence. You'd better use a git diff tool to compare original version and solved version to better understand the ES6 features those unit tests show. You can use webstorm, gitx, gitk, source tree etc., or just use diff tool in this site.
